# *`Enhancing Loan Approval Status Prediction Using Machine Learning`*

![Alt text](../Data/Status.png)

## Introduction to the Project:

In this project, I aim to predict the loan status (Approved or Not Approved) based on various features of loan applicants.
To achieve this, I will carry out essential steps, including data exploration, preprocessing, and visualization, to gain insights into the dataset. Additionally, I plan to utilize Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers for the initial machine learning tasks.

Furthermore, I am exploring the implementation of a neural network model to further improve predictions performance. Please note that this project is under development and may undergo modifications and improvements in the future.

Loan approval involves multiple factors, such as education, number of dependents, credit history, and more, to determine an individual's creditworthiness. By developing an accurate loan status prediction model, valuable insights can be provided to financial institutions, streamlining the loan approval process and facilitating more informed lending decisions.

## Problem Statement:

Imagine a financial institution that receives numerous loan applications daily. The process of manually evaluating each application is time-consuming and prone to errors. The challenge is to build a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict whether an applicant's loan should be approved or not based on their personal and financial information.

## Features of the data :

Gender =                Male/ Female <br>
Married =               Applicant married (Yes/No) <br>
Dependents =            Number of dependents <br>
Education =             Applicant Education (Graduate/ Not Graduate) <br>
Self_Employed =         Self-employed (Yes/No) <br>
Applicant_Income =      Applicant income <br>
Coapplicant_Income =    Coapplicant income <br>
Loan_Amount =           Loan amount <br>
Term =                  Term of the loan in days <br>
Credit_History =        Credit history <br>
Area=                   Urban/ Semiurban/ Rural <br>
Status =                Loan approved (Y/N) <br>
